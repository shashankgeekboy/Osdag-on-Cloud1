#### ostag on cloud project
Approach I used---

Research: I researched the best open-source libraries for reading and displaying CAD files on the browser. I also looked into the Django REST framework for creating RESTful APIs.

Implementation: I started implementing the frontend using React and Three.js library to display the CAD files. I used the STLLoader from Three.js to load the STL files.

Backend: I implemented the backend using Django and Django REST framework for creating RESTful APIs.

Integration: Finally, I integrated the frontend and backend by making API calls from the frontend to the backend using fetch() function in JavaScript.

Technologies  I used:

React: For creating the frontend application
Three.js: For displaying the CAD files in the browser
Django: For creating the backend application
Django REST framework: For creating RESTful APIs
New Packages:

Three.js: A JavaScript library used to create and display 3D graphics in a web browser.
Django REST framework: A powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs.
